  <h2>Lance Armstong:  Sports Biggest Fraud</h2>
  <h3>The Accusations - Page 3</h3>
    <h4><strong>2009–2011</strong></h4>
    <p>
    Ashenden's findings were disputed by the Vrijman report, which pointed to procedural and privacy issues in dismissing the
    LNDD test results. The Los Angeles Times article also provided information on testimony given by Swart, the Andreus,
    and an instant messaging conversation between Frankie Andreu and Jonathan Vaughters regarding blood-doping in the peloton.
    Vaughters signed a statement disavowing the comments and stating he had "no personal knowledge that any team in the
    Tour de France, including Armstrong's Discovery team in 2005, engaged in any prohibited conduct whatsoever." Andreu
    signed a statement affirming the conversation took place as indicated on the instant messaging logs submitted to the court.
    The SCA trial was settled out of court, and while no verdict or finding of facts was rendered, Armstrong regarded the outcome
    as proof that the doping allegations were baseless.

    <h4>Floyd Landis</h4>

    <p>
    On May 20, 2010, former U.S. Postal teammate Floyd Landis – who had previously been stripped of the 2006 Tour de France title
    after a positive drug test – accused Armstrong of doping in 2002 and 2003. Landis also claimed that U.S. Postal team director
    Johan Bruyneel had bribed former UCI president Hein Verbruggen to keep quiet about a positive Armstrong test in 2002.
    Landis admitted there was no documentation supporting his claims.
    However, in July 2010 the president of the UCI, Pat McQuaid, revealed that Armstrong made two donations to the UCI: $25,000
    in 2002, used by the juniors anti-doping program, and $100,000 in 2005, to buy a blood testing machine, and documentation of
    those payments did exist.
   </p>
    <p>
    Landis also maintained that he witnessed Armstrong receiving multiple blood transfusions, and dispensing testosterone patches
    to his teammates. On May 25, 2010, the UCI disputed Landis's claims, insisting that "none of the tests revealed the presence
    of EPO in the samples taken from riders at the 2001 Tour of Switzerland." According to ESPN, "Landis claimed that Armstrong
    tested positive while winning in 2002, a timeline Armstrong himself said left him 'confused,' because he did not compete in
    the event in 2002."

    <h4>Tyler Hamilton</h4>

    <p>
    In May 2011, former Armstrong teammate Tyler Hamilton told CBS News that he and Armstrong had together taken EPO before and
    during the 1999, 2000, and 2001 Tours de France. Armstrong's attorney, Mark Fabiani, responded that Hamilton was lying.
    The accompanying 60 Minutes investigation alleged that two other former Armstrong teammates, Frankie Andreu and George Hincapie,
    have told federal investigators that they witnessed Armstrong taking banned substances, including EPO, or supplied Armstrong
    with such substances.
    </p>
    <p>
    Fabiani stated in response that, "We have no way of knowing what happened in the grand jury and so can't comment on these
    anonymously sourced reports." Hamilton further claimed that Armstrong tested positive for EPO during the 2001 Tour de Suisse;
    60 Minutes reported that the Union Cycliste Internationale intervened to conceal those test results, and that donations from
    Armstrong totaling US$125,000 may have played into said actions.
  </p>
    <p>
    Martial Saugy, chief of the Swiss anti-doping agency, later confirmed that they found four urine samples suspicious of EPO
    use at the 2001 race, but said there was no "positive test" and claimed not to know whether the suspicious results belonged
    to Armstrong. As a result, Armstrong's lawyers demanded an apology from 60 Minutes. Instead of apologizing, CBS News chairman
    Jeff Fager said CBS News stands by its report as "truthful, accurate and fair", and added that the suspicious tests which
    Saugy confirmed to exist have been linked to Armstrong "by a number of international officials".
  </p>
    <h4><strong>2012</strong></h4>
    <p>
    On February 2, 2012, U.S. federal prosecutors officially dropped their criminal investigation with no charges.
  </p>
    <p>
    Interviewed for Hardtalk on the BBC News channel, Hamilton again insisted that he and Armstrong had routinely doped
    together. Dismissing the fact that Armstrong had passed numerous drug tests, Hamilton said that he himself had also
    passed hundreds of drug tests while doped.
  </p>
    <p>
    In the 2012 documentary "The World According to Lance Armstrong", the attorney Jeffrey Tillotson states that he thinks
    the evidence he and his team developed showed that Armstrong had been using performance-enhancing drugs dating back to
    the beginning of his career. Tillotson was engaged by an insurer that unsuccessfully tried to refuse to pay Armstrong
    five million USD in bonuses for Armstrongs performance in the Tour de France in 2006, based on their collection of
    evidence on Armstrong using performance-enhancing drugs.
  </p>
    <p>
    On October 10, 2012, the U.S. anti-Doping Agency said Armstrong was part of "the most sophisticated, professionalized
    and successful doping program that sport has ever seen," in advance of issuing its long-awaited report detailing the
    evidence it acquired. In December 2012, Armstrong and his attorney Tim Herman held a secret meeting at the Denver
    offices of former Colorado governor Bill Ritter, in an attempt to negotiate a reduction of Armstrong's lifetime ban down
    to one year. But the talks fell apart when Armstrong refused to cooperate with U.S. Anti-Doping Agency CEO Travis Tygart.
