  <h2>Lance Armstong:  Sports Biggest Fraud</h2>
  <h3>The Accusations - Page 2</h3>
    <h4><strong>2006â€“2008</strong></h4>

    <p>
    In June 2006, French newspaper Le Monde reported claims by Betsy and Frankie Andreu during a deposition that Armstrong
    had admitted using performance-enhancing drugs to his physician just after brain surgery in 1996. The Andreus' testimony
    was related to litigation between Armstrong and SCA Promotions, a Texas insurer who balked at paying a $5 million bonus
    for Armstrong's sixth Tour victory due to the claims raised in L. A. Confidentiel. This was settled out of court with SCA
    paying Armstrong and Tailwind Sports $7.5 million, to cover the $5-million bonus plus interest and lawyers' fees.
    Betsy Andreu's testimony stated, "And so the doctor asked him a few questions, not many, and then one of the questions
    he asked was... have you ever used any performance-enhancing drugs? And Lance said yes. And the doctor asked, what were they?
    And Lance said, growth hormone, cortisone, EPO, steroids and testosterone."

    Armstrong suggested Betsy Andreu may have been confused by possible mention of his post-operative treatment which included
    steroids and EPO that are taken to counteract wasting and red-blood-cell-destroying effects of intensive chemotherapy.
    The Andreus' allegation was not supported by the eight other people present, including Armstrong's doctor Craig Nichols,
    or his medical history. According to Greg LeMond, he had recorded a conversation, transcribed for review by National
    Public Radio, which Armstrong's contact at Oaklety, Inc., Stephanie McIlvain, corroborated Betsy Andreu's account.
    However, McIlvain contradicted LeMond's allegations and denied under oath that the incident ever occurred.

    In July 2006, the Los Angeles Times published a story on the allegations raised in the SCA case. The report cited evidence
    at the trial including the results of the LNDD test and an analysis of these results by an expert witness. According to
    the Times, Australian researcher Michael Ashenden testified that Armstrong's levels rose and fell, consistent with a series
    of injections during the 1999 Tour. Ashenden, a paid expert retained by SCA Promotions, told arbitrators the results painted
    a "compelling picture" that the world's most famous cyclist "used EPO in the '99 Tour."

   SCA president Bob Hamman knew his chances of winning the suit were slim, since the language in SCA's contract with Armstrong
   stipulated that the money had to be paid. However, he believed that the testimony and evidence would prove that Armstrong was
   a doper, and would be enough to trigger an investigation by sporting authorities. His hunch proved right; before the Times
   ran its story on the case, United States Anti-Doping Agency general counsel Travis Tygart contacted Hamman and asked to see
   the evidence he'd gleaned.
