  <h2>Lance Armstong:  Sports Biggest Fraud</h2>
  <h3>The Accusations - Page 1</h3>
    <h4><strong>1995–2005</strong></h4>
    <p>
    Armstrong faced accusations of doping as early as the 1999 Tour de France. Specifically, many European papers contended
    his victory in Stage 9, in which he seemingly ascended the Alps with almost no difficulty, could not have been possible
    through natural means. Armstrong adamantly denied this, and the American press generally supported him. Armstrong contended,
    among other things, that it would have made no sense for him to dope since he lived in France for most of the year; France
    has some of the strictest anti-doping laws in the world.

    Armstrong was criticized for working with controversial Italian trainer Michele Ferrari. Ferrari claimed that he was
    introduced to Lance by Eddy Merckx in 1995. Greg LeMond described himself as "devastated" on hearing of them working
    together, while Tour de France organizer Jean-Marie Leblanc said, "I am not happy the two names are mixed."
    Following Ferrari's later-overturned conviction for "sporting fraud" and "abuse of the medical profession", Armstrong
    suspended his professional relationship with him, saying that he had "zero tolerance for anyone convicted of using or
    facilitating the use of performance-enhancing drugs" and denying that Ferrari had ever "suggested, prescribed or provided
    me with any performance-enhancing drugs."

    Ferrari was later absolved of all charges by an Italian appeals court of the sporting fraud charges as well as charges
    of abusing his medical license to write prescriptions. The court stated that it overturned his conviction "because the
    facts do not exist" to support the charges. Ferrari, however, is still banned from practicing medicine with cyclists by
    the Italian Cycling Federation. According to Italian authorities, Armstrong met with Ferrari as recently as 2010 in a
    country outside of Italy.

    In 2004, Walsh and fellow reporter Pierre Ballester published a French-language book alleging Armstrong had used
    performance-enhancing drugs, entitled L. A. Confidentiel – Les secrets de Lance Armstrong. The book contains
    allegations by Emma O'Reilly that Armstrong once asked her to dispose of used syringes and to give him makeup to
    conceal needle marks on his arms.[citation needed] Another figure in the book, Steve Swart, claims he and other riders,
    including Armstrong, began using drugs in 1995 while members of the Motorola team, a claim denied by other team members.

    Allegations in the book were reprinted in the British newspaper The Sunday Times in a story by deputy sports editor
    Alan English in June 2004. Armstrong sued for libel, and the paper settled out of court after a High Court judge in a
    pre-trial ruling stated that the article "meant accusation of guilt and not simply reasonable grounds to suspect."
    The newspaper's lawyers stated, "The Sunday Times has confirmed to Mr. Armstrong that it never intended to accuse him
    of being guilty of taking any performance-enhancing drugs and sincerely apologized for any such impression." Ballester
    and Walsh subsequently published L.A. Official and Le Sale Tour (The Dirty Trick), further pressing their claims
    Armstrong used performance-enhancing drugs throughout his career.

     On March 31, 2005, Mike Anderson filed a brief in Travis County District Court in Texas, as part of a legal battle
     following his termination in November 2004 as an employee of Armstrong. Anderson worked for Armstrong for two years as
     a personal assistant. In the brief, Anderson claimed that he discovered a box of androstenone while cleaning a bathroom
     in Armstrong's apartment in Girona, Spain. Androstenone is not on the list of banned drugs. Anderson stated in a subsequent
     deposiion that he had no direct knowledge of Armstrong using a banned substance. Armstrong denied the claim and issued a
     counter-suit. The two men reached an out-of-court settlement in November 2005; the terms of the agreement were not disclosed.
