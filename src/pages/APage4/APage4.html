  <h2>Lance Armstong:  Sports Biggest Fraud</h2>
  <h3>The Admission </h3>
  <p>
    On January 4, 2013, The New York Times reported that Armstrong had told associates and antidoping officials that he was
    considering publicly admitting having used banned performance-enhancing drugs and blood transfusions during his cycling
    career. Armstrong's attorney, Tim Herman, denied the report that he had decided to admit to doping charges and told the
    Associated Press: "When, and if, Lance has something to say, there won't be any secret about it."

  In an interview with Oprah Winfrey on January 13, 2013 (aired later in two parts), Armstrong admitted to using
  performance-enhancing drugs throughout much of his career, including all seven Tour de France wins. During the interview,
  Armstrong stated that his "mythic, perfect story" was "one big lie", and attributed his denials to being "a guy who
  expected to get whatever he wanted, and to control every outcome." The Associated Press and other media reported that
  Armstrong had made an apology to the Livestrong staff before his interview with Winfrey. Armstrong said that while doping,
  he neither felt that it was wrong nor felt bad about what he was doing.

  In that interview, Armstrong also insisted he was clean during the two comeback years of 2009 and 2010, after UCI had
  implemented its biological passport program that included stricter whereabouts rules and the monitoring of blood profiles.

  Macur wrote that Armstrong decided to admit his doping because he knew he would be questioned under oath about it in the
  False Claims Act suit filed by Landis. He was also concerned about the toll it was taking on his kids. As Macur put it,
  Armstrong wanted to "confess on his own terms."
